Code notes:

basically have a thing where the base function is the only one that needs a recalculation for all side. For the falling function it wqill ask a 300 dot recalculation, and for itself it will always have 300 dots, all in the same position then we do the recalc.
The recalc would be basially to do F_new.y = F1.y -F2.y; the X would be the same X for all of them. as in it starts at like the highest minimum X to the Highest maximum X and from there it increments 300 dots. 

in theory it all works fine. 
the issue is game design - cant understand these functions without content.
SHould it stay this way?

I think we need a Grid for the player

Fix scaling then see if the issue persists.

The scaling works on a tesdt zone, need top fix it for the new game.

re do all the functons, let them normalize, give them 3f scale more or less. i mean 2 should be fine tho.

the main issue i anticipate is that they all moved from the center, so things will be in a offset, which is a issue.
the workaround is to either recenter which is a bitch and a half, or just move things to the left abit or right, depending on the sazew of nod=es they have.
